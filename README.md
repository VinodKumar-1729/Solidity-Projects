# Solidity Projects
In this repository, I'm uploading the projects based on solidity.

Project 1: 
features : 1.Manager(who manages the contest) 2.Participants(who spend their ether and one of the participants will be a winner) 3. Participants must be more than 2. 4]Manager will have access to balance and select the winner.

Project 2:
There will be two entities 1. Manager 2.Contributor.
In this contributors contribute money and the manager will collect the money. Whenever there is a need the manager will request the contributors to vote. if more than 50% agree, the manager can send the money to the recipient.
